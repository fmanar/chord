- objects or dictionaries?
- Pitch refernce?
- too many functions?  Am I doing it wrong? 
- a Voicing is a Chord is Pattern?  What about a Scale? Or a Diatonic Chord?
- Casting in Python... and preserving input types.
- file organization
- test organization
- git etiquette
- classes for lists of notes?
- who has a root?
- name pitch? tone?
- PitchSequence -> PitchPattern -> chord, scale, voicing, diatonic
- chord needs "pitches" input?
- chord/voicing is or has pitches? IS
- I'm just putting new names on existing things....
- python wrappers don't create a setter for lists?!?!?! -> immutable types


## Functional Approach
- notes are numbers in lists
- positions are tuples
- chords are dictionaries
